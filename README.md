# 2025 Autumn Pygame Workshop

## Folder Structure

### `exercise/` Folder
- Contains starter code with `pass` statements and `# TODO` comments
- Identical structure and assets as `solution/`, but with incomplete implementations

### `solution/` Folder
- Complete reference implementation with all game logic
- Solution blocks are wrapped with:
  ```python
  # SOLUTION START --
  # Your solution code here
  # -- SOLUTION END

### Workflow
- Participants work in exercise/ to complete the code
- solution/ serves as a reference when needed
- Use the stripping script to reset exercises:
    ```bash
    chmod u+x ./strip_solutions.sh
    ./strip_solutions.sh
